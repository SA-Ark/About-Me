# About-Me

I am a sales professional turned software engineer with a passion for technology that began in my early years with the discovery of online gaming. Through my schooling and work experience, I have developed a love for problem-solving and an entrepreneurial spirit. After gaining valuable experience in sales roles, I transitioned to a hybrid job as a computer science tutor, where I rediscovered my love for the technical aspects of the field. I challenged myself to do more and received great feedback for revamping our course offerings. I then joined a tech boot-camp where I built scalable, user-friendly web applications and used my knowledge of cybersecurity concepts to make them secure. With excellent pair programming and mentoring skills honed by my diverse experiences, I am excited to contribute my skills to your team.
